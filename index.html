                Hi!  I’m Stacy, and I am a new web developer who is ready to launch a career in web development!  Previously I have worked in the field of zoology.  Then after playing with some online coding tutorials, I discovered how fun programming can be!  So, I enrolled in the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp to flex my coding muscles and develop some amazing programming skills.

                Coding is a perfect combination of interests for me: logic and math, order and organization, and being creative.  There is so much joy in creating things. In recent years, I have taught myself to knit, sew, and make jewelry.  Making beautiful webpages from lines of code is just as fun!
            </p>

            <p>
                When I’m not working on a project, I can be found enjoying my love for animals, either volunteering at Seattle’s Woodland Park Zoo, or at home with my dogs.  I moved to Seattle with my husband ten years ago from Ohio, and I have loved life on the west coast ever since.  Go Sounders!
